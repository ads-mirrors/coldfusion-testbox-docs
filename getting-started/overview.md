# Overview

TestBox is a next generation testing framework for the [BoxLang JVM language](https://www.boxlang.io) and for ColdFusion (CFML) that is based on BDD (Behavior Driven Development) for providing a clean obvious syntax for writing tests. It contains not only a testing framework, runner, assertions, mocking/stubbing and expectations library. It also supports xUnit style of testing with MXUnit compatibilities.
