# Test Browser

TestBox ships with a test browser that is highly configurable to whatever URL accessible path you want. It will then show you a test browser where you can navigate and execute not only individual tests, but also directory suites as well.

* BoxLang: `/testbox/bx/test-browser`
* CFML: `/testbox/cfml/test-browser`

It is also a mini web application that can be configured to whatever root folder you desire.  It will read the runners and tests from that folder and present a GUI that you can use to navigate the test folders and execute them easily.
