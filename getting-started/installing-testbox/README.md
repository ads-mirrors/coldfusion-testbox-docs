# Installation

TestBox can be installed easily via [CommandBox CLI](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) as a development dependency in your projects:

```bash
// latest stable version
box install testbox --saveDev

// latest bleeding edge
box install testbox@be --saveDev
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note the `--saveDev` flag, which tells CommandBox that TestBox is a development dependency and not a production dependency.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
DO NOT USE TESTBOX IN PRODUCTION.
{% endhint %}

## TestBox CLI

TestBox comes with its own CLI for CommandBox.  You can use it to generate tests, harnesses, and suites and also run executions from the CLI.

```bash
install testbox-cli
```

You will now have the `testbox` namesapce available to you, try it out

```bash
testbox help
```

## Generating a Testing Harness

Once you install TestBox, you'll need a quick way to set up a testing harness. The `generate harness` command will add a new `/tests` folder to your application with a few example tests to get you started.

```bash
testbox generate harness
```

You can then run your tests by executing the `testbox run` command or by visiting the runner in the generated harness: `http://localhost/tests/runner.cfm`

```
testbox run
```
