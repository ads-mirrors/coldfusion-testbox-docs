# Mocking Methods

Once you have created a mock object, you can use it like the real object, which will respond exactly as it was coded. However, you can override its behavior by using the mocking methods placed on the mocked object at run-time. The methods that you can call upon in your object are the following (we will review them in detail later):

| Method Name                                                                                                                                                            | Return Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Must be called concatenated to a $() call and must be followed by a concatenated $results() call so the results are matched to specific arguments. |
| `$getProperty(name, scope)`                                                                                                                                            | any         | Retrieve any public or private internal state variable so you can do assertions and more mocking.                                                                                                         |
