# What's New With 6.2.0

This release certifies the entire test suite to run on BoxLang alone, no modules needed, not even CFML compat.

### Improvement

[TESTBOX-413](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/TESTBOX-413) refactor of `evaluate` to use a direct approach instead of requiring the module for $getproperty mocking

[TESTBOX-414](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/TESTBOX-414) BoxLang only updates and testing
