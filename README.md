# Introduction

## TestBox BDD v5.x

![TestBox](.gitbook/assets/TestBoxLogo300.png)

**TestBox** is a next-generation testing framework for the [BoxLang](https://www.boxlang.io) JVM language and ColdFusion (CFML) based on [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven\_development) (Behavior Driven Development) for providing a clean, obvious syntax for writing tests. It contains not only a testing framework, console/web runner, assertions, and expectations library but also ships with MockBox, A mocking and stubbing companion.&#x20;

```java
class{

  function run(){
  	describe( "My calculator features", () => {
	
		beforeEach( () => {
			variables.calc = new Calculator()
		} )
			
		// Using expectations library
		it( "can add", () => {
			expect( calc.add(1,1) ).toBe( 2 )
		} )
		
		// Using assert library
		test( "it can multiply", () => {
			$assert.isEqual( calc.multiply(2,2), 4 )
		} )
	} )
  }

}
```
{% endtab %}

	function testAdd(){
	    expect( calc.add(1,1) ).toBe( 2 )
	}
		
	// Any name, but with a test annotation
	// Using assertions library
	@test

	    $assert.isEqual( calc.multiply(2,2), 4 )
	}
}
