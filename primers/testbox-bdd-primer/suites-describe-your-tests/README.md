# Suites: Describe Your Tests

A test suite in TestBox is a collection of specifications that will model what you want to test. The way the suite is expressed can be of many different types as we will investigate.

> Test suite is a container that has a set of tests which helps testers in executing and reporting the test execution status.

A test suite begins with a call to our TestBox `describe()` function with at least two arguments: a `title` and a `body` function/closure. The `title` is the name of the suite to register and the `body` function/closure is the block of code that implements the suite.

When applying BDD to your tests, this function is used to describe your story scenarios that you will implement.

```javascript
function run( testResults, testBox ){

     describe("A suite", function(){
          it("contains spec with an awesome expectation", function(){
               expect( true ).toBeTrue();
          });
          it("contains spec with a failure expectation", function(){
               expect( true ).toBeFalse();
          });
     });

}
```

The `describe()` function is also aliased with the following names:`story(), feature(), scenario(), given(), when()`
{% endhint %}

## Arguments

There are more arguments which you can see below:

| Argument   | Required | Default | Type         | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`    | true     | ---     | string       | The title of the suite to register                                                                                                 |
| `body`     | true     | ---     | closure/udf  | The closure that represents the test suite                                                                                         |
| `labels`   | false    | ---     | string/array | The list or array of labels this suite group belongs to                                                                            |
| `asyncAll` | false    | false   | Boolean      | If you want to parallelize the execution of the defined specs in this suite group.                                                 |
| `skip`     | false    | false   | Boolean      | A flag or a closure that tells TestBox to skip this suite group from testing if true. If this is a closure it must return boolean. |
