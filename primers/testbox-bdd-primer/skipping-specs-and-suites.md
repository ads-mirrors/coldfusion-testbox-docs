# Skipping Specs and Suites

Specs and suites can be skipped from execution by prefixing certain functions with the letter `x` or by using the skip argument in each of them. The reporters will show that these suites or specs where skipped from execution. The functions you can prefix are:

* `it()`
* `describe()`
* `story()`
* `given()`
* `when()`
* `then()`
* `feature()`

```javascript
xdescribe("A spec", function() {
     it("was just skipped, so I will never execute", function() {
          coldbox = 0;
          coldbox++;

          expect( coldbox ).toBe( 1 );
     });
});

describe("A spec", function() {
     it("is just a closure, so it can contain any code", function() {
          coldbox = 0;
          coldbox++;

          expect( coldbox ).toBe( 1 );
     });

     xit("can have more than one expectation, but I am skipped", function() {
          coldbox = 0;
          coldbox++;

          expect( coldbox ).toBe( 1 );
          expect( coldbox ).toBeTrue();
     });
});
```

## Skip Argument

The `skip` argument can be a boolean value or a closure. If the value is **true** then the suite or spec is skipped. If the return value of the closure is **true** then the suite or spec is skipped. Using the closure approach allows you to dynamically at runtime figure out if the desired spec or suite is skipped. This is such a great way to prepare tests for different CFML engines.

```javascript
describe(title="A railo suite", body=function() {
     it("can be expected to run", function() {
          coldbox = 0;
          coldbox++;

          expect( coldbox ).toBe( 1 );
     });

     it(title="can have more than one expectation and another skip closure", body=function() {
          coldbox = 0;
          coldbox++;

          expect( coldbox ).toBe( 1 );
          expect( coldbox ).toBeTrue();

     },skip=function(){
          return false;
     });

},skip=function(){
     return !structKeyExists( server, "railo" );
});
```
