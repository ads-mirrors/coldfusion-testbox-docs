## New Text Reporters

## Editor URL Integrations

The simple reporter has been updated to add editor opening integration.  Now all the tag contexts and traces are links and will open in your favorite IDE of choice.  You can control the editor by using the `url.editor` parameter in the URL or via your runner.
