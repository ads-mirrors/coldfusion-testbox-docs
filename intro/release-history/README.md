## Version 4.0 - April 2020

In this release we have dropped support for legacy CFML engines and introduced the ability  to mock data, relationships and build JSON documents.

## Version 3.0

In this release we focused on dropping engine supports for legacy CFML engines.  We had a major breakthrough in introducing Code Coverage thanks to the [FusionReactor](https://www.fusion-reactor.com/) folks as well.  This major release came also with a new UI for all reporters and streamlining the result view ports.

## Version 2.0

This version spawned off with over 8 minor releases.  We focused on taking TestBox 1 to yet a high level.  Much more attention to detail and introducing modern paradigms like given-when-then.  Multiple interception points, async executions and ability to chain methods.

## Version 1.0

This was our first major version for TestBox.  We had completely migrated from MXUnit and it introduced BDD to the ColdFusion (CFML) world.
